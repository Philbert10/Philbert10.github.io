Women that carry their children before they are born and then continue to take care them throughout their childhood and even into adulthood. Moms make sure that their children are safe and happy through their childhood. It is the unconditional love that a mother feels for her children that drives these feelings. It is hard to describe the feeling that a mom has towards her children. Most people don’t understand this love unless they are mothers themselves.</div>
